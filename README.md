This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that is out of bounds. The code attempts to access the element at index 5 in a vector of size 3, which results in a runtime panic. The solution shows how to correctly handle this situation by using the `get()` method which returns an `Option` and checking if it is `Some` before accessing the value.
